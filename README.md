# big_data_assignments
Assignments as given in the course of CSE545. All assignments are part of this course

Assignment 1:
Blog Corpus Industry Mention count using Spark:
In this assignment, we were supposed to parse the blog corpus:(http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm) and run on spark to 1. Find all the industries.
2. Get the number of times a industry was mentioned in all the blogs


Assignment 2:
Satellite Image Analysis to find similar regions using Spark and AWS
Dataset: https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/high_res_ortho
The goal of the assignment was to find similar regions in Long island using satellite image and running the code as in AWS.
Objectives:
Implement Locality Sensitive Hashing.
Implement dimensionality reduction -- learn through doing.
Gain further experience with Spark.
Gain further experience with data preprocessing.
Explore a different modality of data: satellite images.

Here I used Incremental SVD as proposed in 
"Sarwar, Badrul, et al. "Incremental singular value decomposition algorithms for highly scalable recommender systems." Fifth International Conference on Computer and Information Science. Citeseer, 2002."
